# Time Series Prediction Models

In my journey to explore the vast world of **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning**, I delved into various time series prediction models.

## Overview
The primary aim was to understand, implement, and evaluate different models on their capability to forecast time series data, specifically stock prices. The `Close` price was predominantly chosen as a feature for model building.

## üìä What's Inside:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preparation
- Split the data into **training** and **test** sets.
- Scaled the data for smoother model ingestion.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Prophet Model
- Conducted parameter tuning using grid search to identify the optimal changepoint and seasonality prior scales.
- Utilized the best performing parameters for predictions on the test data.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ XGBoost
- Employed random search over a broad parameter space for hyperparameter optimization.
- Assessed the model's performance on a hold-out test set.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ SARIMA & ARIMA
- Implemented these classic time series forecasting methods.
- Benchmarked their performance using metrics like MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Linear Regression
- Utilized dates as a single feature to predict the 'Close' prices.
- Analyzed its forecasting power with MAE and RMSE.

## üìå Note
The code and methods highlighted above offer a simplified representation of the entire process. The insights gleaned from the results were both fascinating and invaluable in understanding stock price behaviors.
